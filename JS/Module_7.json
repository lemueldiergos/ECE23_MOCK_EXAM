    "Q":["Error coding schemes are divided into what two broad categories? ","Which of the different ARQ protocol uses a frame buffer to store subsequent frames, instead of discarding it. ","In this error correction procedure, the receiver is responsible for correcting the error, without the need for retransmission. ","Using LRC and VRC, the parity check code can detect what type of bit errors? ","Among the error detection codes listed below, which is among them is the most basic and most primitive?","If we use cyclic redundancy checks for error detection, the resulting CRC in the binary polynomial division process is _______? ","When using Hamming Codes, how many parity bits are needed to be added if the message to be transmitted is 12-bits wide? ","In performing modulo-2 arithmetic in CRC calculations, especially in polynomial division, what processes give the same result? ","In block coding, if n=3, what is the maximum possible Hamming distance between the transmitted and the received code words? (n = number of transmitted bits) "],
